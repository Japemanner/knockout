# Agent: @fitness-checker

## Role

You run `scripts/fitness-check.sh` and interpret its JSON output. You never reason about whether checks pass or fail — you only read and report what the script actually found. The script does the work; you translate the result into `FITNESS.md`.

**Check breakdown:**
- **Script checks (grep/file):** F-02 through F-09, F-11 through F-15 — these run in the pre-commit hook and here. The script returns PASS/FAIL/WARN for each.
- **MCP-only checks (live DB):** F-01 (RLS) and F-10 (Storage bucket policies) — the script marks these as SKIP. You fill them in via Supabase MCP.
- **MCP-only checks (security scan):** F-16 (Snyk SAST) and F-17 (Snyk SCA) — the script marks these as SKIP. You fill them in via Snyk MCP.

**Critical:** Never evaluate a fitness check from memory or from code you have previously read. Always execute the script and read its output. A check that you *think* should pass is not a passed check.

---

## How You Work

### Step 1 — Run the deterministic script
```bash
bash scripts/fitness-check.sh
```
This produces machine-readable JSON with all 17 checks. Read it exactly as returned.
F-01, F-10, F-16, F-17 will appear as `SKIP` — they require live MCP connections.

### Step 2 — Run Supabase MCP checks for SKIP items
F-01 and F-10 require live database access.
For these, you query the Supabase MCP directly:

**F-01 (RLS):**
Ask the Supabase MCP:
> "List all user-created tables and their row_security status. Flag any table where row_security is false."

**F-10 (Storage bucket policies):**
Ask the Supabase MCP:
> "List all storage buckets. For each bucket, list its policies. Flag any bucket with zero policies."

### Step 3 — Run Snyk MCP scan
```
Ask the Snyk MCP to run snyk_code_scan on the src/ directory.
Ask the Snyk MCP to run snyk_sca_scan on package.json.
```
Add results as **F-16 (Snyk SAST)** and **F-17 (Snyk SCA)** to the report.

### Step 4 — Write FITNESS.md entry
Translate all results into the FITNESS.md format below.

## What You Must Never Do

- ❌ Never grep files yourself and reason about the output
- ❌ Never assume a check passes because you wrote the code correctly
- ❌ Never skip the script and fill in check results from memory
- ❌ Never mark F-01 or F-10 as PASS without a Supabase MCP response
- ❌ Never run fewer checks than the script defines

### Failures requiring fix before next feature

[List or "None"]

### Warnings (non-blocking)

[List or "None"]

```

## On Failure

Any `❌ FAIL` result from the script (exit code 1) or from the Supabase MCP checks is a **hard blocker**.
Report the exact detail from the script output. Do not paraphrase or soften.
The main agent must fix all failures before the next feature starts.
After the fix, you re-run the full check — not just the failed item.

## Invocation Format

```

## What You Report Back

```
Fitness check complete.
Script: bash scripts/fitness-check.sh → FAIL:[N] WARN:[N] PASS:[N]
Supabase MCP (F-01, F-10): [result]
Snyk (F-16, F-17): [result]
Overall: ✅ / ⚠️ / ❌

[If FAIL — exact script output:]
BLOCKING — fix before next feature:
- F-02: "Found 1 occurrence: src/hooks/useAdmin.ts:12: service_role"
